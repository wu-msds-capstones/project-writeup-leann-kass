# Conclusions

The rise in debt at graduation over the generations suggests that newer graduates are starting their post-college lives with heavier financial burdens. Higher student loan debt can directly impact their ability to save for a down payment and secure mortgages, potentially delaying their entry into homeownership.






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing our research question—how do differences in student loan debt between older and current generations affect homeownership trends?—our study offers both insightful and nuanced perspectives. The historical context and the analysis reveal a complex relationship between student loan debt and homeownership rates. Our findings indicate that student loan debt at graduation (*debt_at_grad*) is a significant factor influencing homeownership rates. The data shows a clear increase in student loan debt across generations, with Millennials bearing the highest levels, which is likely contributing to the challenges they face in achieving homeownership. Despite the substantial debt load carried by recent graduates, the impact of debt at graduation on homeownership is relatively moderate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through linear regression and Random Forest analyses, we confirmed that *debt_at_grad* has a less pronounced but still notable effect. *Percent_education_loan*, while less influential than mortgage debt, also plays a role, suggesting that education loan debt does impact homeownership trends to a degree. Interestingly, *generation_order*, representing the sequence of generations, was found to be the least significant predictor of homeownership rates. This indicates that, within the context of our model, generational cohort alone does not substantially explain variations in homeownership rates compared to the financial burden of student loans and mortgages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, while student loan debt does impact homeownership trends, it is just one of several factors contributing to the complexity of financial decisions related to homeownership. The rising debt levels faced by Millennials and Gen Z are significant but must be considered alongside other financial elements. Our research underscores the need for a holistic view when analyzing homeownership trends and suggests that addressing the broader financial challenges faced by younger generations may be crucial in facilitating increased homeownership rates.
