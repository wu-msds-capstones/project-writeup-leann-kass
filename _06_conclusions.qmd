# Conclusions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing our research question—how do differences in student loan debt between older and current generations affect homeownership trends?—our study offers both insightful and nuanced perspectives. The historical context and the analysis reveal a complex relationship between student loan debt and homeownership rates. Our findings indicate that student loan debt at graduation is a significant factor influencing homeownership rates. The data shows a clear increase in student loan debt across generations, with Millennials bearing the highest levels, which is likely contributing to the challenges they face in achieving homeownership.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our analysis revealed a marked increase in average graduation debt from Baby Boomers to Millennials, with Millennials bearing the highest levels of debt. This rise in debt aligns with a trend of increasing financial burden on recent graduates. Our examination of homeownership rates indicated significant fluctuations influenced by economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, yet an overall upward trend in recent years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Linear Regression model provided a good fit with an R-squared value of 0.712 and significant predictors such as mortgage debt, though the results were tempered by issues such as multicollinearity and the limitations of aggregated data. The Random Forest model outperformed the linear regression model in predictive accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.745 and demonstrated that student loan-related variables, particularly `debt_at_grad` and `percent_education_loan`, were the most influential factors affecting homeownership rates.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Random Forest model provided more robust results, the linear regression model’s findings were also valuable, highlighting the complexity of the relationships between debt and homeownership. The models collectively suggest that high levels of student loan debt are a barrier to homeownership, though challenges like multicollinearity and data limitations need to be addressed. The confidence in our results is bolstered by the consistency between the two modeling approaches, despite the inherent limitations of the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our linear regression and Random Forest analyses, we confirmed that `debt_at_grad` has a less pronounced but still notable effect. `Percent_education_loan`, while less influential than mortgage debt, also plays a role, suggesting that education loan debt does impact homeownership trends to a degree. Interestingly, `generation_order`, representing the sequence of generations, was found to be the least significant predictor of homeownership rates. While generational trends and experiences might shape broader economic and social patterns, the specific generational cohort an individual belongs to does not substantially explain variations in homeownership rates compared to the financial burden of student loans and mortgages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As illustrated in [Figure 7](#figure-7), the variables `percent_education_loan` and `debt_at_grad` emerge as the most influential factors in predicting the homeownership rate. This highlights the significant role that student loan debt plays in determining an individual’s likelihood of owning a home. The substantial impact of `percent_education_loan` suggests that the proportion of education-related debt an individual carries is a determinant of homeownership. Similarly, `debt_at_grad` indicates that the amount of debt incurred by graduation also affects homeownership prospects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial to acknowledge that student loan debt is not the sole determinant of homeownership trends. Inflation, for instance, has affected purchasing power and contributed to rising housing costs, which can make homeownership more challenging for many. Additionally, extensive evidence highlights how student loan debt creates barriers in mortgage eligibility and credit scores. According to a study by the Federal Reserve Board, a $1,000 increase in student loan debt is associated with a 1.8 percent decrease in the homeownership rate for public four-year college graduates, resulting in a delay in purchasing a home [@ChicagoJournal]. Furthermore and as addressed above, despite our efforts to mitigate bias, the potential for underrepresentation of certain demographics in the survey samples remains a concern. Student loan debt can exacerbate racial disparities. Racial wealth and income gaps are rooted in historical discriminatory housing policies - meaning that Black students, in particular, may face greater financial risks in pursuing higher education [@race]. Not adequately capturing the experiences of these underrepresented groups can affect our research and must be taken into consideration when evaluating our results. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, while student loan debt does impact homeownership trends, it is just one of several factors contributing to the complexity of financial decisions related to homeownership. The rising debt levels faced by Millennials and Gen Z are significant but must be considered alongside other financial elements such as debt levels, income and savings. Our research underscores the need for a holistic view when analyzing homeownership trends and suggests that addressing the broader financial challenges faced by younger generations may be crucial in facilitating increased homeownership rates. This insight also emphasizes the need for targeted policies and interventions that address financial barriers directly, rather than focusing solely on generational characteristics. By prioritizing measures that alleviate student loan debt and improve financial stability, stakeholders can more effectively support homeownership aspirations across different generational cohorts.
