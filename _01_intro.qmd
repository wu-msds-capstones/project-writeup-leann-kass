# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As current students, student loans are at the forefront of our minds and loom over us as we juggle the stress of financial burdens and the need for education to grow and succeed in life. Societal pressures push us to graduate college, start our careers, buy a house and start a family. But are Millennials and Gen Z’ers able to fall into place and follow the footsteps of the generations before them? Or are they facing additional challenges with the outstanding debt they’re accumulating with student loans? This project aims to shed light on our research question: how do differences in student loan debt between older and current generations affect homeownership trends?
