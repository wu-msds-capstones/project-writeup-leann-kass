# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As current students, student loans are at the forefront of our minds and loom over us as we juggle the stress of financial burdens and the need for education to grow and succeed in life. Societal pressures push us to graduate college, start our careers, buy a house and start a family. But are Millennials and Gen Z’ers able to fall into place and follow the footsteps of the generations before them? Or are they facing additional challenges with the outstanding debt they’re accumulating with student loans? This project aims to shed light on how differences in student loan debt between older and current generations influence homeownership trends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, homeownership has been a cornerstone of wealth accumulation for American families as it provides stability and financial security across generations [@homeownership2024]. However, in the aftermath of the Great Recession and amidst rising costs of higher education, younger generations are increasingly burdened by substantial student loan debt [@NIH; @CFR; @equitablegrowth]. According to 2024 data, outstanding student loan debt in the United States has surpassed $1.75 trillion, which is a 67% increase from the previous decade [@federal2024]. Research has shown that high levels of student debt can delay or reduce the likelihood of homeownership [@ChicagoJournal; @FederalReserveBoston; @Upjohn]. By comparing older generations (Baby Boomers and Gen X) with younger generations (Millennials), we can better understand how the landscape of student debt has evolved and its implications on long-term financial decisions such as homeownership for younger generations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the difference in student loan debt composition across different generations holds personal significance to us as members of the current generations facing the burden of student loans. It speaks to the experiences of students navigating the complexities of higher education financing and the challenges they face in achieving future financial stability, including homeownership. By examining these dynamics, our research aims to empower individuals with knowledge to make informed financial decisions and advocate for systemic reforms.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study also reflects on the evolving societal norms and expectations surrounding higher education and homeownership. It highlights the shift towards higher education attendance and the resulting increase in student loan debt, which affects traditional milestones such as home ownership. Ultimately, our research contributes to building a more inclusive and resilient society by addressing systemic barriers to economic opportunity and wealth accumulation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, our  research holds significant merit, with the potential to drive positive societal change. A better understanding of generational differences in student loan debt and its implications on homeownership rates can lead to more informed policies, such as targeted student loan forgiveness programs or tailored financial assistance for first-time homebuyers burdened by educational debt. It can also enhance educational programs by promoting financial literacy initiatives that help students make informed borrowing decisions. Furthermore, this understanding can contribute to a more equitable and prosperous future by addressing disparities in debt accumulation across generations and fostering greater economic mobility for younger individuals.
