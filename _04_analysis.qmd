# Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine how differences in student loan debt between older and current generations affect homeownership trends, we focused on several key variables. Firstly, we examine the debt at graduation (*debt_at_grad*), which quantifies the amount of student loan debt individuals had upon completing their studies. Additionally, we consider the generational order (*generation_order*), identifying whether individuals belong to the Baby Boomers, Generation X, or Millennials. Due to the lack of data compiled for Gen Z, we chose to exclude this generation from our comparative analysis. Another important variable is the percent of education loans (*percent_education_loan*), which represents the proportion of total debt an individual has attributed to education loans. Finally, we analyze the homeownership rate (*homeownership_rate*), calculated by dividing the total number of homes surveyed by the total number of homes owned and multiplying by 100, to determine the proportion of the population that owns a home. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first focused on analyzing the overall trend of student loan debt by generation. We calculated the average graduation year for each row within our dataset in order to conduct this analysis. Our analysis revealed a clear upward trajectory in debt levels over time for each successive generation, shown in Figure 1. For the Baby Boomers, graduates had relatively low levels of student loan debt, which remained stable and below $5,000 through the 1970s and early 1980s. In contrast, Generation X experienced a noticeable increase in debt levels starting in the late 1980s, with a steady rise through the 1990s, peaking around $15,000 by the early 2000s. This trend continues with Millennials, who faced the highest levels of debt at graduation. Starting in the early 2000s, the average debt for this generation saw a steep increase, surpassing $20,000 and reaching nearly $30,000 by 2015. This escalation in student loan debt across generations highlights a growing financial burden on recent graduates, with Millennials bearing the highest debt load. The data suggests significant changes in higher education financing, economic conditions, and possibly policy impacts over the decades.
